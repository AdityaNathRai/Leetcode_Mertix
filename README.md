# Leetcode_Mertix
LeetCode Matrix is a frontend web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that helps developers track their coding practice in a structured and visually appealing way. Instead of using plain lists or spreadsheets, this project transforms progress tracking into an interactive matrix-style dashboard that highlights solved and unsolved problems.

The idea behind this project is to combine minimalistic design with practical functionality, giving learners a quick overview of their progress while also motivating them to stay consistent.
